It discusses a possible Riemannian metric, which is to play the role of the Hilbert metric, that is, it is invariant under projective transformations and, in the case of the ball {\textbar}x{\textbar} {\textless} 1, reduces to hyperbolic Riemannian metric. It is defined in terms of a solution of the boundary value problem for a positive, strictly concave function u defined in Ω.},
