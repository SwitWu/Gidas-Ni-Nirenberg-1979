\begin{abstract}
  We prove symmetry, and some related properties, of positive solutions of second order elliptic 
  equations. Our methods employ various forms of the maximum principle, and a device of moving 
  parallel planes to a critical position, and then showing that the solution is symmetric about 
  the limiting plane. We treat solutions in bounded domains and in the entire space.
